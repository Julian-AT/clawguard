# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** When a developer @mentions ClawGuard on a PR, it must find real vulnerabilities, show them clearly in an interactive report, and fix them autonomously.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Bot Wiring

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation & Bot Wiring)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-27

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Chat SDK + Next.js integration is highest risk -- validate in Phase 1 or fall back to direct Octokit
- [Roadmap]: v0 SDK used at dev-time only (Phase 4), not runtime critical path
- [Roadmap]: Config/policies deferred to Phase 5 -- pipeline works with hardcoded defaults first
- [Phase 01]: Used GitHubRawMessage type import from @chat-adapter/github for type-safe raw message access
- [Phase 01]: vi.hoisted() required in Vitest 4.x for mock variables referenced by hoisted vi.mock factories
- [Phase 01]: Bot tests use source code analysis (readFileSync) to avoid Chat SDK initialization side effects

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Chat SDK GitHub adapter examples only target Hono, not Next.js -- 2-hour time-boxed spike needed in Phase 1
- [Research]: Vercel Sandbox runs only in iad1 (US East) -- 100-150ms latency from Vienna hackathon venue
- [Research]: Zod 4 edge cases with AI SDK structured output -- test exact schemas in Phase 2
