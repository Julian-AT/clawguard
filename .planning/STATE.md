## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Chat SDK + Next.js integration is highest risk -- validate in Phase 1 or fall back to direct Octokit
- [Roadmap]: v0 SDK used at dev-time only (Phase 4), not runtime critical path
- [Roadmap]: Config/policies deferred to Phase 5 -- pipeline works with hardcoded defaults first

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Chat SDK GitHub adapter examples only target Hono, not Next.js -- 2-hour time-boxed spike needed in Phase 1
- [Research]: Vercel Sandbox runs only in iad1 (US East) -- 100-150ms latency from Vienna hackathon venue
- [Research]: Zod 4 edge cases with AI SDK structured output -- test exact schemas in Phase 2
